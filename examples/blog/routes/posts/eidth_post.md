excerpt: There are many many types of citrus.  In fact, lemons are not a species, but a hybrid of citrus. Limes too. There are only three species of edible citrus that are the ancestors to all the citrus we have today.  C. medica (citron), C. maxima (pomelo), and C. reticulata (mandarin orange).  Everything else—navel oranges, lemons, limes, and even grapefruits—are all hybrids of one or more of these species. Even within the hybrids, there is great diversity from the range of planting and span of cultivation. Citrus has been cultivated for thousands of years, and in that time, traits were selected, and genes have mutated.  There are even real pink lemons, variegated lemons, and variegated plants too!
